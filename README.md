Simple Registration and Login Form Project Overview The Simple Registration and Login Form project is a lightweight and straightforward web application that allows users to register, log in, and access secure content. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project includes the essential features of user authentication, including registration, login, and password recovery. It uses front-end validation to ensure that the data entered is in the correct format and provides a seamless user experience. This project is a great starting point for learning about web security, form handling, and user authentication systems.

Key Features User Registration:

Users can sign up by entering their username, email, and password. Front-end validation ensures proper input formats (e.g., email format, password strength). User Login:

Registered users can log in with their username/email and password. Validation checks if the credentials match the ones stored in the system. Password Recovery:

Users can reset forgotten passwords by providing their registered email address. Simulated password recovery with a mock email system. Session Management:

After logging in, users are assigned a session, keeping them logged in until they log out. Basic Front-End Validation:

Ensures that fields are not left empty and that email addresses follow the correct format. Password strength check (e.g., minimum length, use of numbers/letters). Responsive Design:

Designed to work across different devices with a responsive layout, making it mobile-friendly. Simple Backend Simulation:

The backend is simulated using JavaScript for demonstration purposes, with login credentials stored locally (ideal for learning purposes). For production, this can be extended to a real backend with a database. User-Friendly Interface:

Clean and simple design focused on ease of use, providing a smooth experience for the user. Security Features:

Passwords are handled with basic hashing in the back-end simulation (using SHA-256 or similar for security purposes). Customization:

Easily customizable to fit any project or extended with additional features like user roles, email verification, or social login integration. Technologies Used Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript Backend (simulated): JavaScript (for client-side validation and session management) Security: SHA-256 password hashing (for demonstration) Installation Guide Clone the Repository:

bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/username/simple-registration-and-login-form.git cd simple-registration-and-login-form Open the Application:

Open index.html in your browser to start using the registration and login form. Customization:

Modify the script.js file to change logic or connect to a real backend (e.g., Node.js, PHP, or Python).
